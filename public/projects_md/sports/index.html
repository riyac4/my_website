<h5>Thoughts and Explanations</h5>
<p>I've played quite a few sports in my life. My first true love will always be soccer (and no I'm not calling it football). I played soccer for around 6 years. Towards the end I started to hate it more and more. It took up too much time and I wasn't very good lol.<br>
I was forced to do swim team. I hated it. Only partipated for around 3 years and that to only during the summer.<br>
I played basketball for two years. I used to play on a rec team and I was a beast. However, middle school basketball humbled me real quick and I learned that I wasn't very good.<br>
Track was the first sport I did that I truly enjoyed. Obivously there were moments I hated but some of my favortite middle school and high school memories come from track. I ran track for 4.5 years and was mainly a distance runner. I ran the 800m (my favorite event), 1600m, and 3200m. I wasn't the fastest but would often quialfy for invites. My PR in the 800m is a 2.43, in the 1600m a 6.15, and in the 3200m a 14 flat. My goal is to break 6 minutes in the 1600m but I feel like my prime track days are over 😔 <br>
The last sport I took up was tennis and played it for 3 years. I often played 1st or 2nd doubles because I was never good enough for a singles spot. During one of my last matches of senior year I played 3rd singles and subsquently played in one of my best matches of tennis ever. I came back a set and few games down to win. I really wish I played more singles in high school.
<br>
<br>
I play a lot of sports recreatioanlly as well. On top of the sports listed above I also play tennis a lot in my free time. I'm a huge badminton fan and while I initially hated pickle ball as a tennis purist, I've grown to really enjoy the sport.</p>

<h5>Thoughts and Explanations</h5>
<p>As you can see I'm a huge soccer fan. I'm also a huge Man City fan (I know very controvieral). The story of how I became a fan goes a little something like this. It had been around the time when I started to get more into watching soccer. I remember turning on the TV and seeing a game. I had no idea who the two teams were but decided to vote for the blue team even though red is my favorite color and the other team was red. I also realized the blue team had to win this game in order to win the tourneament (what the commentators were saying). I became invested and watched a majority of the match. Towards the end, my mom came in and saw what I was watching. She then realized that the match being shown was a replay and she read about it in the news a few days ago. The game I was watching: Man City V QPR Final Matchday 2012. If you know anything about soccer you know that match. That's all it took. I was a City fan. I also saw City during their 2014 American Tour at Heniz Field in Pittsburgh. I rememebr I was so upset that they didn't bring Augero or David Silva and said I didn't want to go. Despite my anger, I still went to the match and took a pic next to the EPL trophy. I also got my first soccer scarf. People can call me a bandwagon, oil money, or loving a &quot;cheating&quot; team but city will always have my heart 🩵.</p>
<p>Dortmund becuase they produce great players and play in black and yellow 😃<br>
AC Milan mainly because of Pulisic lol<br>
Barcelona because I am a Messi fan and the Spain 2010-2012 team which had a lot of players playing for barca<br>
I am a huge Carlos Alcaraz fan and have been for the past 4 years. Also gotta show my love for American tennis players so thats why Shelton is up there too. Big Coco fan and so lucky I got to see her play during the QF of the 2023 U.S. Open. Iga, I ❤️ you!<br>
I might have an obession with Spanish Athletes named Carlos...<br>
Follow the Sunrisers becuase I've been to Hyderabad multiple times (what a joke of an IPL final). <br>
American Sports Leagues are all 🖤 💛 Pittsburgh 💛 🖤 teams (bc I'm from there) except MLS bc Pittsburgh doesn't have one. I'm a Crew fan bc I went to one of their games + the black and yellow doesn't hurt. College sports is all 🧡 💙 Illinois 💙 🧡 (I-L-L)(bc i go there)(I-N-I)</p>
